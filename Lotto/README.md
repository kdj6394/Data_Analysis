# Ontario649 Lotto Predict

A collection of scripts to collect and process previous winning lottery numbers

A Keras LSTM model is trained using the collected data, and while it
does seem to predict the numbers correctly, it does not predict the correct
numbers. More work is needed to correctly train the model and possibly set up
more layers of the neural-network.
